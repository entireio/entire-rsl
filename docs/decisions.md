# Decisions

Non-obvious decisions, newest last. Each entry records the context, the
decision, and the alternatives rejected. Sources are cited at the version
pinned in `go.mod` (gittuf fork `github.com/pjbgf/gittuf` at `a818fabe`) or at
entireio/cli `main` as of 2026-10-19 (`21836151e`).

## 2026-10-21: Toolchain versions

- **Context:** SPEC.md section 6 names Go 1.27.3 and golangci-lint 2.15.0 but
  also says to use whatever entireio/cli `main` pins, which is Go 1.27.1 and
  golangci-lint 2.13.2.
- **Decision:** Go 1.27.3 and golangci-lint 2.15.0, the latest releases, per
  Phase 0 answer 14.
- **Rejected:** matching entireio/cli exactly. It lags the latest patch release.

## 2026-10-21: gittuf from the pjbgf fork

- **Context:** upstream gittuf v0.17.0 gates `VerifyRefFromEntry` behind
  developer mode (`experimental/gittuf/verify.go:86`, `GITTUF_DEV=1`), and the
  Entire CLI's environment filter would drop that variable anyway. Its go-git
  storage backend is also developer-mode only
  (`experimental/gittuf/storer.go:83`).
- **Decision:** `replace github.com/gittuf/gittuf => github.com/pjbgf/gittuf`
  at `a818fabe` (branch `inspect-api`), per Phase 0 answer 5. Its `pkg/policy`
  exposes `VerifyRef`, `VerifyRefFromEntry` and `InspectRoot` over any
  `gitstore.Storer`, with no developer-mode gate.
- **Rejected:** setting `GITTUF_DEV=1` in-process (it unlocks features gittuf
  documents as able to undermine security), and upstream v0.17.0 alone.
- **Follow-up:** the branch is 11 commits behind v0.17.0 and lacks c96b2a72
  ("policy: Improve validation of policies"). Move the pin once the branch is
  rebased or merged upstream.

## 2026-10-21: Process-wide debug logger is injected

- **Context:** gittuf logs through the default `slog` logger, so surfacing its
  diagnostics in debug mode means replacing the process default. That is global
  state, which parallel tests would race on.
- **Decision:** `cli.Options.SetDefaultLogger` is the only path to
  `slog.SetDefault`. `main` passes `slog.SetDefault`, tests pass nil.
- **Rejected:** calling `slog.SetDefault` inside the command tree.
